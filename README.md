## Task 2 - JavaScript

In the `JavaScript` directory there are four JavaScript files with exercises for you to complete. Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

### Task A: Objects and Arrays
Test your knowledge of advanced array methods and callbacks.

Use the arrays-callbacks.js link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

### Task B: Closure
This challenge takes a look at closures as well as scope.

Use the closure.js link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

### Task C: Prototypes
Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.
